### The thing

Simple mobile app which collects wait times of voters at polling places and feeds data into a realtime to centralized database(s). Built during VIP Hackathon #viphack http://votinginfoproject.org/

We made a web API for saving and retrieving wait time data.
Applications can use this to add wait time recording.
The API is written in web.py, and it stores data in a CouchDB.

### Demo
We made a mobile website that lets you record and look up
wait times using the wait time API.
